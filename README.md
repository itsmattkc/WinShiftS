# Win+Shift+S

Lightweight screenshotting tool that imitates the functionality of Win+Shift+S in Windows 10 1703+ but in much earlier versions of Windows.

After opening this tool, pressing Win+Shift+S will allow you to make a rectangular selection of the screen and the resulting snippet of screenshot will be copied to the clipboard ready for pasting anywhere.

This tool does not automatically install itself and will need to be manually made a "startup item" by a method of your choice.

This tool is compatible with the following versions of Windows:
* Windows 98/98SE
* Windows 2000
* Windows Me
* Windows XP
* Windows Server 2003 (Web/Standard)
* Windows Vista
* Windows 7
* Windows 8/8.1
* Windows 10 prior to 1703
